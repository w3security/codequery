/**
 * Provides classes for reasoning about certain property accesses as access paths.
 *
 * Access paths represent SSA variables with zero or more property accesses applied to them.
 * Each property name in the access must either be constant or itself be a use of an SSA
 * variable.
 *
 * If `x` and `y` are SSA variables, then `x`, `x.p`, `x.p["q"]`, `x[y]` and `x[y].q` are
 * access paths, but `x[x.y]` is not an access path.
 *
 * Access paths can be used to identify expressions that have the same value, disregarding
 * any heap modifications. In general, expressions that are instances of the same access
 * path are not guaranteed to evaluate to the same value nor do all expressions that evaluate
 * to the same value have the same access paths, so access paths are neither sound nor
 * complete as an approximation of expression semantics.
