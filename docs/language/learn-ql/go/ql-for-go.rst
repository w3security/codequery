This page provides an overview of the CodeQL for Go documentation that is currently available.

-  `Basic Go query <https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/console/ql-go-basic-example>`__ describes how to write and run queries using LGTM.

-  :doc:`Introducing the CodeQL libraries for Go <introduce-libraries>` introduces the standard libraries used to write queries for Go code. There is an extensive CodeQL library for analyzing Go code. This tutorial briefly summarizes the most important classes and predicates provided by this library.
