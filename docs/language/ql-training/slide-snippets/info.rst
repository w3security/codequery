.. note::

   To run the queries featured in this training presentation, we recommend you download the free-to-use `QL for Eclipse plugin <https://help.semmle.com/ql-for-eclipse/Content/WebHelp/getting-started.html>`__.

   This plugin allows you to locally access the latest features of QL, including the standard QL libraries and queries. It also provides standard IDE features such as syntax highlighting, jump-to-definition, and tab completion.

   When you have setup QL for Eclipse we recommend increasing the “Memory for running queries” from the default setting of 4096MB to 8192MB, to ensure that all the queries complete quickly.
