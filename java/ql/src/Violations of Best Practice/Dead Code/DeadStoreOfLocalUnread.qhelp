<overview>
<p>A value is assigned to a local variable, but the variable is never read subsequently. This means
that the original assignment is suspect, because the state of the local variable that
it creates is never used.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>Ensure that you check the control and data flow in the method carefully.
If a value is really not needed, consider omitting the assignment. Be careful,
though: if the right-hand side has a side-effect (like performing a method call),
it is important to keep this to preserve the overall behavior.</p>
