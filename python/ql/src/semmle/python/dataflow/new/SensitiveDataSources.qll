   *
   * To handle calls properly, while preserving a good source for path explanations,
   * you need to include this predicate as an additional taint step in your taint-tracking
   * configurations.
   *
   * The core problem can be illustrated by the example below. If we consider the
   * `print` a sink, what path and what source do we want to show? My initial approach
   * would be to use type-tracking to propagate from the `not_found.get_passwd` attribute
   * lookup, to the use of `non_sensitive_name`, and then create a new `SensitiveDataSource::Range`
   * like `SensitiveFunctionCall`. Although that seems likely to work, it will also end up
   * with a non-optimal path, which starts at _bad source_, and therefore doesn't show
   * how we figured out that `non_sensitive_name`
   * could be a function that returns a password (and in cases where there is many calls to
   * `my_func` it will be annoying for someone to figure this out manually).
   *
   * By including this additional taint-step in the taint-tracking configuration, it's possible
   * to get a path explanation going from _good source_ to the sink.
   *
   * ```python
   * def my_func(non_sensitive_name):
   *     x = non_sensitive_name() # <-- bad source
   *     print(x) # <-- sink
   *
   * import not_found
   * f = not_found.get_passwd # <-- good source
   * my_func(f)
   * ```
